# Todo MCP Server

This repository provides an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server for interacting with the [Todo App](https://github.com/Adhishtanaka/todo-app) through Claude and other MCP-compatible AI tools. This project allows AI agents to access and manage todos using the standardized MCP interface.
